# Chase Sets Marketplace

## Purpose
- Define implementation-ready product, architecture, and domain documentation.
- Provide a single source-of-truth map for engineers and AI agents.
- Keep repository scope documentation-first until code implementation starts.

## Audience
- AI agents that need source-of-truth navigation and contracts.
- Engineers defining scope, interfaces, and constraints.

## Scope / Non-scope
- In scope: documentation for product, domain, architecture, data, API, engineering standards, planning, and operations.
- Non-scope: runtime implementation code in this repository at this stage.

## Quickstart
1. Read `docs/README.md`.
2. Read `docs/product/PRD.md`.
3. Read `docs/domain/README.md`.
4. Read `docs/setup.md`.
5. Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Repository Structure
- `docs/`: canonical docs hub.
- `services/`: service ownership guides.
- `infra/`: infrastructure playbook.

## Related docs
- [Documentation Index](docs/README.md)
- [Agent Guide](AGENT.md)
- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Skill Index](SKILL.md)

## Next steps
- Keep all new documentation under `docs/` unless service-local guidance is required.
- Add runbook procedures as soon as executable services exist.
