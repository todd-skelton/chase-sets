# Chase Sets Marketplace

## Purpose
Chase Sets is a pre-code documentation repository for a collectibles marketplace architecture and product design.

## Audience
- AI agents that need source-of-truth navigation and contracts.
- Engineers defining implementation-ready scope, interfaces, and constraints.

## Current State
- Application code is not implemented in this repository.
- Documentation is the source of truth for product, architecture, domain, API, and operational standards.

## Quickstart
1. Read `.ai/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`.
2. Read `.ai/CONTEXT_INDEX.md`.
3. Read `docs/setup.md`.
4. Follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Repository Structure
- `docs/`: canonical product, domain, architecture, API, data, engineering, planning, and runbook docs.
- `docs/adrs/`: architecture decisions.
- `.ai/`: compact pointer-first summaries for agent workflows.
- `domains/`: domain-specific requirements and terminology.
- `services/`: service ownership guides.
