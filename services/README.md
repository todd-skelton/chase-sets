# Services Documentation

## Purpose
Provide the canonical entry point for service-level ownership guides.

## Audience
- Engineers defining service boundaries.
- AI agents applying service-local rules.

## Scope
Each service guide defines ownership, interfaces, invariants, and references.

## Service Guides
- `accounts/AGENT.md`
- `catalog/AGENT.md`
- `integrations/AGENT.md`
- `listings/AGENT.md`
- `orders/AGENT.md`
- `search/AGENT.md`
- `shipping/AGENT.md`
- `trust-safety/AGENT.md`

## Interface Status
Service-local OpenAPI/event directories are planned but not yet present in this pre-code repository. The canonical API contract currently lives at `../docs/api/openapi.yaml`.
