# Architecture Docs

## Purpose
Provide the canonical architecture documentation map.

## Audience
- Engineers defining runtime boundaries and cross-cutting constraints.
- AI agents producing architecture-consistent updates.

## Scope
Covers system boundaries, quality attributes, deployment topology, and threat posture.

## Start Here
1. [System Overview](SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)
2. [Quality Attributes](QUALITY_ATTRIBUTES.md)
3. [Deployment Topology](DEPLOYMENT_TOPOLOGY.md)
4. [Threat Model](THREAT_MODEL.md)
5. [ADR 0001](../adrs/0001-initial-architecture.md)

## Rules
- Architecture docs must remain consistent with accepted ADRs.
- Cross-cutting decisions must be recorded in `docs/adrs/`.
- Runtime claims must remain aligned with repository source-of-truth docs.
