# Apps

This folder will contain deployable applications for Chase Sets.

Planned MVP apps:

- `apps/api`: Platform HTTP API (the marketplace web client uses the same APIs as external clients, behind guardrails).
- `apps/web`: Web app (primary client).
- `apps/workers`: Background workers (projectors, indexing, webhooks).

See:

- `plan.md` (Build Readiness & Implementation TODOs)
- `artifacts/11-development-standards.md`
- `artifacts/04-system-architecture-overview.md`
