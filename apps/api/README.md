# apps/api

Placeholder for the MVP HTTP API.

Posture: API-first. The marketplace web client uses the same APIs available to external clients (subject to guardrails).

See `artifacts/04-system-architecture-overview.md` and domain docs under `domains/`.

Guardrails expectations are defined in `artifacts/11-development-standards.md` and `artifacts/30-scale-targets-and-capacity-planning.md`.
