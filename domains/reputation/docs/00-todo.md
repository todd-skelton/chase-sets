- [ ] Validate scope boundaries with Orders, Trust & Safety, and Marketplace.
- [ ] Define reputation eligibility rules (transaction-complete triggers, time windows, minimum order value).
- [ ] Model rating and review lifecycle (draft → submitted → published → edited/hidden).
- [ ] Define moderation and abuse controls (flags, appeals, automated detection hooks).
- [ ] Decide how aggregated reputation scores are computed and recalculated.
- [ ] Identify API surfaces and read models (profile badges, seller cards, order history).
