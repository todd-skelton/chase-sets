# 2.1 User Personas & Primary Journeys

## Personas

### Persona A: Competitive / frequent buyer (TCG player)

- Goals: find specific singles quickly, at fair prices; trust condition/grade.
- Pain points: version confusion, inconsistent condition grading, fees and friction.
- Tech comfort: medium-high.

### Persona B: Collector / seller

- Goals: list inventory easily, reach real buyers, get fair value.
- Pain points: platform fees, low trust buyers, disputes, catalog mismatch.

## Core journeys

1. **Onboarding / first value**: search an Item → buy now or make an offer.
2. **Sell flow**: search an Item → choose form/condition/grade → create a listing.
3. **Market interaction**: manage offers/listings → buy/sell when an offer is accepted.
4. **Recover from errors**: wrong item selected, wrong condition/grade, duplicate listing.

## Critical moments

- Onboarding: first search-to-action under 2 minutes.
- Failure: mismatch/version confusion (user can’t find the right item).
- Recovery: clear correction flow (cancel/edit listing/offer; report catalog issue).

## Questions to answer

## Open questions

1. Which persona is primary for MVP (buyer-first vs seller-first)?
   - MVP is optimized for **individual hobbyists** who are often **both buyers and sellers** (balanced posture).
2. What is the “first win” moment you want to optimize for (first purchase, first listing, first offer accepted sale)?
3. What are the most common edge cases: version confusion, missing catalog entry, condition disputes, grading verification?
4. What is the top churn driver to design against (fees, slow sales, trust, complexity)?
