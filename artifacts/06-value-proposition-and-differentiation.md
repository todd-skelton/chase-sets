# 1.2 Value Proposition & Differentiation

## Ranked value propositions

1. **Fair marketplace mechanics** for both buyers and sellers (transparent listings/offers, clear outcomes).
2. **Curated, canonical catalog** for Pokémon TCG items (reduces mismatches and confusion).
3. **Fast find → transact** flow (search, filter by form/condition/grade, buy/sell immediately or via offers/listings).

## Differentiators vs alternatives

- vs spreadsheets: structured catalog + marketplace execution (not just tracking).
- vs generic marketplaces: curated catalog + purpose-built TCG workflows (singles/sealed/graded).

## Explicit tradeoffs / non-goals

- MVP trades breadth for trust: no cross-posting/integrations with other platforms.
- MVP trades automation for correctness: no image scanning.
- Marketplace first: collection tracking is not a primary MVP surface.

## Questions to answer

## Open questions

1. What are the top 3 alternatives you want to beat (eBay, TCGplayer, Facebook groups, Whatnot, etc.)?
2. What is the wedge feature that makes people try it first (catalog quality, lower fees, better matching, protections)?
3. What will we _not_ do even if competitors do (auctions, paid boosts, ads, pay-to-win placement)?
4. What is the explicit definition of “fair” (fee caps, offer/listing price gap limits, pro-rata fees, no hidden costs)?
   - MVP definition: transparent policies + competitive fees + protections against fraud/non-fulfillment, with operational costs shared equitably and optimized toward behaviors that reduce costs (e.g., consolidating orders to reduce shipping costs).
